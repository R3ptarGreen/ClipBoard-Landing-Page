## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-responsive
- SCSS
- BEM Method

### What I learned
I learned a lot, and I'm sure I improved so much:

- First: I learned how to use the BEM method more efficiently, I know... I need to practice more, but I improved this topic and I'm proud of myself.  

- second: I learned how to stop using px and how to use rem and em in a specific way, and how to use them to make a responsive design.

- Third: I learned how to make responsive without media queries, and I'm excited to know how to use the vanilla tools of CSS to make them responsive, this part was the most 
frustrating part.

and finally: I learned how to use sass a little bit more efficiently, I need more practice but I'm proud of myself.

### Continued development

Defitnily practice more

### Useful resources

- [HTML and CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload) - This helped me check my html
